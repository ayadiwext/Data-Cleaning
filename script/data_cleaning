-- SQL Project - Data Cleaning

select *
from world_layoffs.layoffs;

-- first thing we want to do is create a staging table. This is the one we will work in and clean the data.

create table world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
like world_layoffs.layoffs;

select *
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging;

insert into world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
select * from world_layoffs.layoffs;

-- now when we are data cleaning we usually follow a few steps
-- 1. check for duplicates and remove any
-- 2. standardize data and fix errors
-- 3. Look at null values and see what 
-- 4. remove any columns and rows that are not necessary - few ways


-- 1. Remove Duplicates

# First let's check for duplicates

select *
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging;


with duplicate_cte as (
select company, 
	   location, 
       industry, 
       total_laid_off, 
       percentage_laid_off, 
       `date`, 
       stage, 
       country, 
       funds_raised_millions,
row_number() over(partition by company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, 
							   `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions) as row_num
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging
)
select company, 
       location, 
       industry, 
       total_laid_off, 
       percentage_laid_off, 
       `date`, 
       stage, 
       country, 
       funds_raised_millions, 
       row_num
from duplicate_cte
where row_num > 1;

-- these are the ones we want to delete where the row number is > 1 or 2or greater essentially. These are our real duplicates 
-- create a new column and add those row numbers in. Then delete where row numbers are over 2, then delete that column

select *
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging;


create table world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2 (
  `company` text,
  `location` text,
  `industry` text,
  `total_laid_off` int,
  `percentage_laid_off` text,
  `date` text,
  `stage` text,
  `country` text,
  `funds_raised_millions` int,
  `row_num` int 
);


select *
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;


insert world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
select company, 
       location, 
       industry, 
       total_laid_off, 
       percentage_laid_off, 
       `date`, 
       stage, 
       country, 
       funds_raised_millions,
row_number() over(partition by company, location, industry, total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, 
							   `date`, stage, country, funds_raised_millions) as row_num
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging;


select *
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
where row_num > 1 ;

-- now that we have this we can delete rows were row_num is greater than 2

delete 
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
where row_num > 1;



-- 2. Standardize Data

select *
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- when we look at industry it looks like we have some null and empty rows, let's take a look at these

select *
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
where industry is null
or industry = '';

-- write a query that if there is another row with the same company name, it will update it to the non-null industry values
-- makes it easy so if there were thousands we wouldn't have to manually check them all
-- we should set the blanks to nulls since those are typically easier to work with

update world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
set industry = null
where industry = '';

-- now if we check those are all null

select *
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
where industry is null
or industry = '';

-- now we need to populate those nulls if possible

update world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2 t1
join world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2 t2
on t1.company=t2.company
set t1.industry=t2.industry
where t1.industry is null 
and t2.industry is not null;

-- and if we check it looks like Bally's was the only one without a populated row to populate this null values

select *
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
where industry is null
or industry = '';

-- ---------------------------------------------------
-- I also noticed the Crypto has multiple different variations. We need to standardize that - let's say all to Crypto

select distinct industry
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
order by industry;


update world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
set industry = 'Crypto'
where industry in ('Crypto Currency', 'CryptoCurrency');

select distinct industry
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
order by industry;

-- --------------------------------------------------
-- we also need to look at country country column

select distinct country 
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
order by country ;

-- everything looks good except apparently we have some "United States" and some "United States." with a period at the end. 
-- let's standardize this.

update world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
set country=trim(trailing '.' from country);

-- now if we run this again it is fixed

select distinct country 
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
order by country ;


-- Let's also fix the date columns:

select `date`
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;

-- we can use str to date to update this field

update world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
set `date` = str_to_date(`date`, '%m/%d/%Y');

-- now we can convert the data type properly

alter table world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
modify column `date` date;

select *
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;



-- 3. Look at Null Values

-- the null values in total_laid_off, percentage_laid_off, and funds_raised_millions all look normal.
-- it's better having them null because it makes it easier for calculations during the EDA phase


-- 4. remove any columns and rows we need to


select *
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
where total_laid_off is null;


select *
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
where total_laid_off is null
and percentage_laid_off is null;

-- Delete Useless data we can't really use

delete
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
where total_laid_off is null
and percentage_laid_off is null;


select * 
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;


alter table world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2
drop column row_num;


select * 
from world_layoffs.layoffs_staging2;
